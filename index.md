The Korthauer lab is a group of researchers working to advance statistical methodology and computational tools for the analysis of high-dimensional genomics data. With these tools, we aim to uncover new molecular signals in cancer, child health, and development. Our group is based at the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca) and [BC Children's Hospital Research Institute](https://bcchr.ca).
