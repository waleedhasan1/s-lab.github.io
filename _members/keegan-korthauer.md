Keegan (she/her/hers) is an assistant professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.ubc.ca) at the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca) and an investigator in the [Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics](https://cmmt.ubc.ca/) at the [BC Children's Hospital Research Institute](https://www.bcchr.ca). She is also a faculty member in the [Bioinformatics](http://www.bioinformatics.ubc.ca/) and [Genome Science and Technology](https://www.gsat.ubc.ca/) graduate programs at UBC. Her research group tackles the challenging task of uncovering meaningful biological insights from large-scale genomic experiments. Innovative technologies now allow scientists to probe the genome in more dimensions and at higher resolution than ever before, providing a wealth of information for studying the genomic basis of complex traits. However, discoveries from these new technologies can often be masked by technical artifacts, systematic biases, or low signal-to-noise ratio - think "needle in a haystack". Keegan leads a team of researchers that focuses on developing novel frameworks and rigorous inferential procedures that exploit the increased scope and scale of high-throughput sequencing data, with the ultimate goal of uncovering new molecular signals in cancer, child health, and development.

Prior to joining UBC and BCCHR, Keegan was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with [Rafael Irizarry](http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu) in the [Department of Data Sciences]( http://datasciences.dfci.harvard.edu) at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org) and the Department of Biostatistics at the [Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu). She earned her PhD in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin Madison](https://www.wisc.edu) with [Christina Kendziorski](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kendzior/).
